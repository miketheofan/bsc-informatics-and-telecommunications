# Airplane-Check-Simulation
Simulation of Airplane Check written in C++. The following is a project created in the context of an Object Oriented Programming course by [Izambo Karali](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~izambo/ENG.html) at the University of Athens.
One of the targets of the project was to introduce the students to two of the most important classes in Java , more specifically "Object class" and "String class" , although the point was to implement them in C++ to completely understand their usage.
# How to execute program
