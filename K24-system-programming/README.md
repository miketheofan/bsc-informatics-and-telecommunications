Projects for the course "K24:System Programming", 2021 by professor: [Mema Roussopoulos](http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~mema/) & [Alexandros Ntoulas](http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~antoulas/)

# Project 1

The purpose of this project is to implement a set of structures (Bloom Filters, Linked Lists, Skip Lists), that allow the import and query of large volumes of citizenRecords. Although the exercise will get its data from files, eventually all records will only be stored in main memory.

# Project 2

The purpose of this project is to familiarize with creating processes using system calls fork/exec, process communication through pipes, low-level use I/O and creating bash scripts.

# Project 3

The purpose of this project is to familiarize with the creation of threads and socket programming.
